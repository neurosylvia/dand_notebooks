    "\n",
    "We have analyzed a dataset of user interaction with a webpage and tried to find determinants of the probability of conversion, i.e. of an individual becoming a subscriber. We see that the experiment was run for about 20 days and it considered three countries, the US, the UK and Canada. We saw that the new version of the webpage did not significantly affect the probability of conversion compared to the old webpage. This was adjusted by coutry, i.e comapred to being US, being in another country did not significantly affect the probability of conversion under a logistic regression model. Similarly, additional days of exposure did not significantly affect $p_{conversion}$ either. \n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained similar results by running hypothesis testing and by running Logistic Regression, with the caveat of using average values in the first and point-by-point values in the latter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we failed to rehect the null hypothesis that there is no difference between old and new page. However, this study may be underpowered for several reasons: \n",
    "1. It may need a larger sample. \n",
    "2. We did not account for the age and other demographics of the users: if the majority of the population is older, they may be change resistant, and therefore our chance of seing a meaningful result with a biased population would be lower. \n",
    "3. It may need to run for a longer amount of time: 20 days may be too little to see any difference. Extending to a period of 2 months could potentilly help. "
